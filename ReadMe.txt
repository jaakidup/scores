League scores calculator

You can run this program "scores.exe" or "scores_linux" 
with an option "-h" to display the help contents.


Scores assumes the inputfile to be named "input.txt" in the current directory

Otherwise you can set specific input and output file by using the 

scores.exe (scores_linux)
  -input filename
  -output filename
